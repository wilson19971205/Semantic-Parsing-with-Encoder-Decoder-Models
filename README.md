# Semantic-Parsing-with-Encoder-Decoder-Models
Basic Encoder-Decoder, Attention

## How to run:
```
python main.py
```

## Introduction:
Semantic parsing involves translating sentences into various kinds of formal representations such as lambda
calculus or lambda-DCS. These representationsâ€™ main feature is that they fully disambiguate the natural
language and can effectively be treated like source code: executed to compute a result in the context of an
environment such as a knowledge base.
